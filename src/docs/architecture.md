# Architecture Overview - E-Commerce Microservices Platform

This document describes the architecture of the **E-Commerce Microservices Platform** hosted on **Kubernetes**. The platform is designed to provide a scalable, highly available, and maintainable solution for e-commerce functionality, supporting multiple vendors, dynamic pricing, inventory management, and payment integrations.

## Key Components

The system architecture follows a **Microservices** approach, where each service is independently deployable and communicates with other services via well-defined APIs.

### 1. **Microservices Architecture**

The e-commerce platform is broken down into several independent services:

- **Product Service**: Handles product listings, details, and updates.
- **Inventory Service**: Manages inventory counts, product availability, and stock updates.
- **Pricing Service**: Calculates and updates dynamic pricing based on business logic.
- **Order Service**: Manages order processing, including order creation, validation, and tracking.
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with external payment gateways to process payments.
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications via email/SMS to users for order updates, payment confirmations, etc.

Each service operates independently and communicates through REST APIs or messaging systems (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ for async processing).

### 2. **Spring Boot**

Each microservice is developed using **Spring Boot**, ensuring fast and efficient development, deployment, and scalability. The services use **Spring Data JPA** for database interaction, **Spring Security** for authentication/authorization, and **Spring Cloud** for distributed systems management.

### 3. **Database Layer**

- **MySQL** is used as the relational database for persistent data storage. Each service has its own dedicated database schema to follow the **Database per Service** pattern.
- The **Product Service**, **Inventory Service**, and other services manage their respective database tables (e.g., products, orders, inventory).

**Database Credentials**: The database credentials (username and password) are stored in a **Kubernetes Secret** to ensure security.

### 4. **Dockerized Services**

Each microservice is **Dockerized** and runs in its own container. This enables the following advantages:

- **Isolation**: Each service is isolated from others, allowing independent scaling and updating.
- **Portability**: Docker containers are portable and can be deployed on any platform that supports Docker.
- **Ease of Deployment**: Containers can be quickly deployed, started, and stopped using Docker commands or Kubernetes.

Each service will have its own Docker image built and pushed to a **Docker Registry** (e.g., DockerHub or a private registry). The Docker images are used for deployment in the Kubernetes cluster.

### 5. **Kubernetes (K8s)**

The microservices are orchestrated and managed by **Kubernetes**, a container orchestration platform, which ensures:

- **High Availability**: Multiple replicas of services can be deployed for fault tolerance.
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes can automatically scale up or down based on traffic or resource usage.
- **Load Balancing**: Kubernetes handles traffic distribution to pods using **Services**.
- **Self-healing**: If a pod or container fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts it.
- **Rolling Updates**: Kubernetes ensures that new versions of services are deployed without downtime.

### 6. **Communication Between Services**

- **Synchronous Communication**: Most of the services communicate synchronously via REST APIs (using **Spring Web**). For example, when an order is placed, the **Order Service** may call the **Inventory Service** and **Pricing Service** to fetch the required information.

- **Asynchronous Communication** (Optional): Services such as **Notification Service** can use an **Event-Driven Architecture** with messaging systems like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** to process events like new orders or payment confirmation.

### 7. **Security**

- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT**: The platform uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication and authorization. The **User Service** is responsible for managing users, logging in, and issuing tokens. Other services verify the token to secure API calls.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users have different roles (admin, vendor, customer), and services implement access control based on roles.

### 8. **External Integrations**

- **Payment Gateway Integration**: The **Payment Service** integrates with external payment systems (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for processing payments. It communicates with the external payment gateway via secure REST API calls.

- **Shipping/Logistics Integration** (Optional): The **Order Service** can integrate with third-party shipping or logistics systems to calculate shipping costs and track deliveries.

### 9. **CI/CD Pipeline**

The project follows a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline using tools such as **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, or **GitLab CI**. The process includes:

- **Building** Docker images for each service.
- **Pushing** the Docker images to a container registry (e.g., DockerHub).
- **Deploying** the images to the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that the latest changes are rolled out.

### 10. **Logging and Monitoring**

- **Centralized Logging**: The application uses **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) or **Fluentd** with **Prometheus** for centralized logging and monitoring.
- **Metrics**: Kubernetes integrates with **Prometheus** for service-level metrics, and **Grafana** is used for visualizing the metrics.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Services use **Spring Cloud Sleuth** and **Zipkin** for distributed tracing and understanding the request flow between microservices.

### 11. **Service Discovery**

The application uses **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka** for **Service Discovery**, which allows services to register themselves and discover other services in the Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that services can dynamically find each other, even if IP addresses change.

### 12. **Deployment Architecture**

The platform uses the following Kubernetes resources:

- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units, each running a container for a microservice.
- **Deployments**: Manages the lifecycle of the pods, ensuring that the desired number of replicas are always running.
- **Services**: Exposes the microservices internally in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Ingress**: Exposes the application externally through an **Ingress Controller**, mapping external URLs to internal services.

### 13. **File System and Persistent Storage**

- **Persistent Volumes (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)** are used for services requiring persistent data storage, such as for caching, file uploads, and databases.
